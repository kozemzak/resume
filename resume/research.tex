        \item {Built SegNet and U-Net with a VGG16 encoder pre-trained on ImageNet to achieve a test dice score of 0.58 in Keras.}
        \item {Incorporated dropout and data augmentation to reduce variance and utilized weighted cross-entropy loss to address class imbalance.}
        \item {Visually presented the results of the project using a Jupyter notebook built on the existing model pipeline.}
